# MiniDI

##### What is this?

A proof-of-concept dependency injector toy, built in about 10 minutes, TDD, to prove that DI is really not a complex subject and shouldn't intimidate anyone.



##### What is this not?

This is _not_ a full-scale dependency-injection framework. It's the bare minimum to demonstrate transient dependency injection - other life-cycles (eg singleton, per-thread or per-web-request) could be implemented, but aren't right now (:
